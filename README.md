# JS-Animations
Javascript animations implemented from scratch using HTML canvas. These simulations mostly depend on physical and mathematical concepts to run. This is a very first attempt at learning JS and scripting inside HTML pages.

1. Ray Casting

This project makes use of linear algebra concepts such as the point of intersection of two linear paths. This was also in order to practice JS Object-Oriented Programming, consequentially, classes are not implemented in the main file. Open the index.html page in a browser (make sure map.js and ray.js class files are in the same folder as well). Move the character with A, S, D, or W keys to go left, down, right, or up.

2. Colored Bouncing Balls

This is a fun little program that simulates the collisions of free floating balls. The key concept here is elastic collisions and how they are managed with vectors in a 2D space. Simply open the index.html file in your browser and enjoy. Reload page to reset.

3. Bouncing Ball

This program launches a red ball with random coordinates, speed, and direction. This simulates the physics of bouncing circles, well as their angular velocity upon collision. A thin line can be seen inside the ball to help visualise rotational moment. Open index.html file in your browser, and reload the page a few times to see the simulation from different positions.
